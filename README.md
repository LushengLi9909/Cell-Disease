# Phenotype-Disease application
This repo contains data and code for shiny web-based application (https://cell-phenotype.shinyapps.io/cell-disease/). 

The **Phenotype-Disease application** can explore the cell-phenotype-disease association. 

The connection between phenotypes and diseases comes from the Human - Mouse: Disease Connection (HMDC). 

And the cell types that were significantly associated with the phenotypes were mapped to the human diseases.
